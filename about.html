            <p> I guess I am a classic kiwi back yarder, working long hours from the garage and getting the job done. I have been doing this forever. Surfboards and any water craft for that matter have long been a significant part of my life, with some resin odors in the air and foam dust on the floor, I am a happy man. I shaped my first board when I was 13 years old so that must have been around 1990. So much has changed since then but all for the better. Along with shaping came surfboard repairs and then it was more repairs than actual shaping but this is perfectly fine. 
            <br></br>   
            Over the years I have shaped many boards and repaired 10 times as many; the nice thing is that there is always a friendly surfer at the other end of each board and conversations on almost every topic have resulted.
            <br></br>
            Surfboards are my thing. Most surfers know this connection. So let keep out of the water for as little time as possible. Lets keep our boards ready to fire on all four, lets be in the water.
