    I offer a fast friendly service and I use quality materials. I am flexible on drop off and pick up times. I think surfers have been paying too much for too long, surfboard repairs don't need to be expensive!
    <br></br> 
    I repair and replace FCS plugs, future fin boxes, glass on fins, snapped board, crease boards , large and small dings and any other damage your board has sustained. I can repair polyester and epoxy boards. SUPs and SUP paddles. I also repair surf club boards, surf skis and pretty much anything that you use in the surf. Basically regardless of the damage your boards has sustained, I will have a solution at a reasonable price!
    <br></br> 
    I am happy to consider any fibre glass work. I am interested in your input as to how you would like to see your board repaired. For example a snap, do you want the stringer replaced or would you rather an extra layer of glass. We can talk about it so you get what you want!
    <br></br> 
    I am also using sun bake UV curing resin which considerably speeds up the curing process while creating a stronger repair. This means your board will be finished much faster. With UV curing resin urgent repairs can be finished in 24 hours.
    <br></br> 
    I continue to do my homework on Epoxy boards, tuflites, firewires etc. Historically they have been taking longer to fix and cost slightly more but this no longer an issue it once was. As the demand increases for epoxy boards and most surfers have one, the epoxy resins are getting better. I stock super fast cure high quality epoxy resin.
    <br></br> 
    Don't see an epoxy board as a disadvantage in regards to getting it fixed. This is no long the issue it once was.
    <br></br> 
    My aim is to get you and your board back in the water quickly for an affordable price. I will beat any genuine quote.
